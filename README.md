# foursquare
Displays results for locations using the Foursquare API

### Requirements:
Android Studio 3.1.3 and API 27 build tools and libraries installed

### Design approach:
The project is a simple app showing a list of venues for the searched location using the Foursquare API.
Despite being simple in features, I wanted the project to showcase the use of the [MVVM design pattern](https://medium.com/@florina.muntenescu/mvvm-rxjava-the-perfect-mix-2d7c3dc8b418) to improve the overall architecture of the app, allowing the behaviour of the app to be unit testable.


### Libraries used: 
Java RX 2, Retroft, Dagger 2, GSON, and Butterknife
